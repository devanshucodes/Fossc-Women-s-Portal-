# Fossc-Women-s-Portal

We at FOSSCU are extremely passionate about promoting people from all diverse groups in the tech community. To inculcate the same idea,we have created a "Women In Tech" community to promote and celebrate all the womens in the tech industry to combat all the patriarchal standards that women have to go through in the industry. In this men-dominated field,it gets hard to navigate the position and relevance of women especially young women who recently have joined the community. So,we at "Women In Tech" have created a community that makes women feel at home,comfortable,and seen in the Industry.We have a mission to close the gender gap,help women embrace Technology and remove all barriers for women to enter into Tech industry,hence we request you to join us in supporting the women in tech.This community will help women to grow and learn together.
