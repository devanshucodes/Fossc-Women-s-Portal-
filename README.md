# Fossc-Women-s-Portal-

We at FOSSCU are extremely passionate about promoting people from all diverse groups in tech community. To inculcate the same idea, we have created a "Women In Tech" community to promote and celebrate all the women in the tech industry to combat all the patriarical standards that women have to go through in the industry. In this men dominated field, it gets hard to navigate the position and relevance of women especially young women who recently have joined the community. So, we at "Women In Tech" have created a community that makes women feel at home, comfortable and seen in the indudstry. We have a mission to close the gender gap and help women embrace technology.
